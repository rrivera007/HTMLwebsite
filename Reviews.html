        <li>Every Aspect of dealing with Pellman Tree SErvice was pleasant from start to finish, in the process of taking down my huge oak tree.  It took months of agonizing interactions with other companies to realize most people/companies in this business are incompetent, unprofessional, dangerous, or all three.  I had several companies never return phone calls, no show appointments or show up to my home unannounced! Thankfully, Pellman Tree Service was the complete opposite.  They operate as every company should.  Communications were prompt, friendly, and professional.  Appointments were kept.  Workers were competent.  Everything was done as expected. I highly recommend them to anyone in the Montgomery County area needing tree removal. -Mimi Kotter, Aug 19, 2018, 5:01pm

        <li>I would highly recommend Pellman Tree Services.  I needed a huge pile of logs from a cut down tree and a big pile of brush removed from my property in time for a party.  I called only a few days before the party and they were able to fit me in.  And, while estimating the work, I asked for an estimate for removal of two large trees and pruning of my Japanese maple and they were able to fit that work in the same weekend and at a very reasonable price.  It was a quick and reasonably priced job (in the rain no less) and he and his crew did a great job and left no trace of any branches or saw dust on the property!  Very happy with the customer service as well as the results. -Cara Rudolph, June 12, 2018, 8:52pm

        <li>I have used Pellman Tree Service and they are very reliable - Gayle Turin, April 15, 2018

        <li>I have been trying to get tree work done for months & was unable to even get a call back. When I got a referral for Pellman Tree Service, not only did I reach someone, the owner came out the next day to provide an estimate. The next week, he and his crew arrived as scheduled & completed all the work weâ€™d agreed to. Good, prompt customer service & a job well done. - Sally Bing, October 7, 2018
Had a maple tree cut down by Pellman Tree Service on Saturday which was a positive experience. Received a reminder call regarding date/time and expectations. The crew was on time and organized, we enjoyed watching the tree slowly being dismantled. We requested the wood chips which was accommodated. The backyard was cleaned - no trash left behind. - Pat Dermet, September 29, 2018

        <li>Pellman took take of our summer weeding and bush trimming on our property quickly and quietly.  They are thoughtful business people and real go-getters.  We plan on using them again for our fall cleanup.  - Carl Horwin, September 1, 2017, 9:55pm
